# Presto-Hacks
This is the website for the hackathon Presto Hacks. It was created by Leslie Lopez and Clarice Kim in 2021 using the repl.it IDE. 
Interactive sections using Javascript (countdown clock, schedule, FAQ) were coded by Leslie. All other elements were created by Clarice. 

The finished website can be viewed here: https://prestohacks.claricekim.repl.co/
